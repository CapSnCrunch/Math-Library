# Personal Math Library
In the Spring 2019 semester, I took a course on Numerical Analysis which covered many computational approaches to typical math problems such as root finding,
matrix row reduction, and linear ODE solving. This project is meant to implement some of the algorithms from this class and to help visualize and understand
topics in couses I took later such as Complex Analysis and Stochastic Processes.

The project is a work in progress as I will try to continually add material from my recently taken courses.
